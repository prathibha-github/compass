"""Goblin-inspired lexical quirk detection.

Inspired by the OpenAI blog post "Where the goblins came from" (April 2026):
reward signals for a playful/nerdy personality caused lexical tics ("goblin",
"gremlin") to spread to unrelated contexts via transfer learning.

Runs the model under 4 system-prompt conditions and surfaces words whose
frequency is anomalously high in one condition versus the others.
